        <p class="intro">
            <b>Coherence Scanning Interferometry</b> is a measurement method used in the fabrication and analysis
             of optical, semiconductor and other surfaces as well as in applied physics research. We take for example the <b>white light interferometry</b>.
             It uses a split beam of light. One beam is used as a reference beam, it's target being a flat reflective plane 
             perpendicular to the measured Z-axis. The secondary beam is directed onto the surface of the sample. The light upon
             impact on the surface of the sample reflects and joins with the reference beam in the beam splitter. These two beams
             interfere with each other and combine, creating an interference pattern - fringes - on the detector. This
             pattern from multiple measurements is then converted into image data and serves for <b>topography and surface analysis</b> of
             the sample.

            <p class="intro">
                Key to this method is a light source. A coherent light source - a light source with long distance frequency, wavelength and phase
                similarity - e.g. a laser - would have lower resolution however greater measurement distance. This is caused 
                by the fact that the waves of a coherent light source have a stable phase over large distances, 
                we can see this in our daily lives, a laser pointer shines brighter and farther as opposed to a simple 
                flashlight. However in this field of optics or semiconductors the feature size that we want to analyze 
                is very small hence no need for long distance (spatial) light coherence. Therefore this method doesn't make use of spatial 
                coherence but only <b>temporal coherence</b>. The name of the selected light source is - 
                as hinted by the name of the method - <b>white light source</b>. This broadband light source has a very short coherence length. 
                As described inthe introduction, both the reference beam and measurement beam combine back together in the beam splitter. 
                If the distance from the light source to the reference mirror is equal to the distance from the light 
                source to the sample we can see that at this moment the waves of both beams are coherent and exhibit
                constructive interference. It must be noted that the difference of both distances must be in a very narrow
                interval which is equal to the coherence length or the length on which the beam is temporaly coherent. 
                This number is only around a wavelength high - ca. 600-700 nm. If the distance to any point on the surface
                of the sample differs either in negative or positive direction, the light in that area doesn't exhibit interference
                on combination with the reference beam. This image of refractive patterns is then captured by a photodetector
                and hence the small coherence length - which serves here as kind of a reference value or the resolution of the 
                system - this method can achieve precise Z-axis surface characterization and profilometry with resolution up 
                to single nanometers with computer calculations and better system or optics adjustments.

        <p class="intro">
            Other key component is a photodetector. 
            For this any CMOS, CCD or other detectors can be used. Usually a CCD camera is used for it's price and spacial convenience.
        </p>
        <p class="intro">
            Using a motorized stage and computing we can achieve larger area scanning by stitching individual scanned bits of the surface
             together. However for most of use cases a manually operated stage is substantionally enough.

        The major manufacturers of optical profilometers and interferometers are <b>Keyence</b> and <b>Zygo</b>.  From Keyence it is the
        <b>VK-X3000</b> and for Zygo it is the new <b>Zegage</b>. Below are also displayed profilometry images of different surfaces and
